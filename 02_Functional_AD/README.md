# Functional anomaly detection

**Anomaly detection** (or **outlier detection**) comprises the **machine learning** methods aimed at identification of observations that exhibit suspicious behaviour and are very likely to cause a problem. In the **unsupervised learning** framework, no label indicating whether a training observation is anomalous or not is available. Hence, anomalies should be identified in an automatic way by learning the *normal* behavior, that of the vast majority of the observations, and considering those differing significantly from it as *abnormal*. Logically, anomalies are rare in the data and thus fall in *low density* regions: anomaly detection thus boils down to identifying the *tail* of the distribution.

With the ubiquitous deployment of sensors monitoring nearly continuously the health of complex infrastructures, **anomaly detection** can now rely on measurements sampled at a very high frequency, providing a very rich representation of the phenomenon under surveillance. In order to exploit fully the collected information, the observations cannot be treated as multivariate data anymore and a functional analysis approach is required.

# The properties of the dataset:

The data set is provided by the Airbus and consistst of the measures of the accelerometer of helicopters during 1 minute at frequency 1024 Hertz, which yields time series measured at in total 60 * 1024 = 61440 equidistant time points.

### Training data:

The training set consists of one file, **airbus_train.csv**.

File **airbus_train.csv** contains one observation per row, each observation having 61440 entries, measures with equivalent time distance of 1 / 1024 seconds.

There are in total 1677 training observations.

### Test data:

The training set consists of one file, **airbus_test.csv**, which has the same structure as file **airbus_train.csv**.

There are in total 2511 test observations.

### Remark:

The task of the **unsupervised anomaly detection** is difficult, in the sense that, strictly speaking, your only feedback will be your score calculated by the submission website.

## The performance criterion:

You should submit a file that contains in each row anomaly score for the observation in the corresponding row of the file **airbus_test.csv**. For a sample submission please see the codes below. Please note, that your score should provide ordering which allows to identify anomalies, i.e. the higher the value of the score, the **more abnormal** the observation should be considered.

The performance criterion is the **Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic** (AUC), see also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve
